The concept of data uniqueness can be generalized as the number of unique valid values that have been entered in a record field, or as a combination of record field values within a dataset. Uniqueness is not generally discussed in terms of data quality, but for the purposes of answering research questions, the variety and richness of the data is of paramount importance. Most notably, if a record field has very little value uniqueness (e.g. entries in the field 'State' for an analysis of housing within a county, which of course would be within a single state), then its utility would be quite low and can be conceptualized as having low quality in terms of the research question at hand.

As simple SQL frequency check on the field 'birth_year' that will return, for each distinct field value, a row containing the count, would look like:

    select birth_year, count(birth_year)
    from student_records
    group by birth_year
