The Commonwealth of Virginia has 132 school divisions that operate under the authority of local school boards. This report describes what divisions are currently collecting by way of child screenings or assessments when children enroll in Kindergarten, in the fall of the Kindergarten year, and in the spring of that academic year. Information was obtained from division personnel through a web-based survey and follow-up telephone contact during the fall term 2009.
