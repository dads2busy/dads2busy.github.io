The purpose of this dissertation is the delineation of a new approach, or, more precisely, a new “role” and “methodological system,” for those persons engaged in building and managing multi-actor structures, or “networks,” for the purpose of policy implementation. As policy formulation and implementation can be viewed increasingly as taking place inter-organizationally, and consisting of individuals, special-interest groups, public organizations, private organizations, non-profits, etc., none of whom have the individual power to autonomously determine the strategies and actions of all the other actors, policy processes can no longer be viewed as the implementation of ex ante formulated goals, but instead must be seen as an interaction process in which actors exchange information about problems, preferences and means, and trade-off goals and resources. That is, the context of “getting things done” in the public sector is changing from a singular organizational context to a multiple-organization network context. Managerially, we must respond accordingly.
