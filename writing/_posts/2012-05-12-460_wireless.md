The Virginia Tech Transportation Institute in cooperation with VDOTâ€™s Christiansburg
Residency deployed one of the first serial wireless networks in the country along Route
460 in Christiansburg and Blacksburg. This deployment provided the foundation for continuing research through the ITS
Implementation Center. The Implementation Center project sought to investigate further
the performance capabilities of wireless networks and the deployment issues that DOTs
might face.
