In late 1999, the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute (VTTI), at the request of the Virginia Department of Transportation, undertook the process of examining the feasibility of expanding Virginia’s Operational Database Management System (ODMS) to include data from neighboring states along the I-81 Corridor. This expanded system was intended to become a multi-state repository for “real time” traffic data that could be used for decision-quality level information for travelers from Bristol, Virginia to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. This data would also be archived for later use as a planning tool for transportation professionals.
To achieve these goals, VTTI went through the process of designing an expanded ODMS and of determining if the other states’ data could be used to fulfill the designs requirements. The first task in the design process was to perform interviews with traffic control professionals along the corridor. The information regarding their data source quality, format, connectivity, and other details was collected and used to create the larger technical design plans.
The information gained from these interviews provided the backbone to create the following plans for the expansion of the database. The design plans included:
• Conceptual System Model
• Clearinghouse Functional Requirements Plan
• Clearinghouse Conceptual, Logical and Physical Data Model Plan
• Functional Design Plan
These documents were then used to assess the different data sources according to technical integrity, institutional barriers, timeliness of data, and overall data quality to determine if the information was of a high enough quality to meet the needs of an expanding ODMS.
