The Child Care Development Fund (CCDF) is a federal work support program to help low-income  families pay for  child  care while parents  are  at  work.    Administered  as  a block grant  to states, the program is designed to enable parents to choose the child care arrangements that best suit their work schedules as well as family needs.   As long-term benefits of high quality early care and education for economically disadvantaged children are increasingly documented, however, a focus  on  the  type  and  quality  of  subsidy  care  has  emerged.    Four  percent  of  each  block  grant award is designated to be applied to efforts to improve the quality of child care or to increase ac-cess to high quality care.   As part of the quality improvement plan in Virginia, CCDF Quality Im-provement (QI) monies are distributed to localities by the Virginia Department of Social Services through the Division of Child Care + Early Childhood Development.  Child Care Consultants lo-cated  in  each  of  the  five  Regional  Offices  review  local  agency  Quality  Initiative  (QI)  plans,  and approve the local departments of social services (LDSS) budgets for QI activities.

This report specifically examines:
* How LDSS across the Commonwealth reported allocating their QI funds in 2009.
* What types of data localities routinely collect on child care quality in their areas.
* What types of information they would like from an early childhood data system.
