Our vision for AISP Innovation is to facilitate a network of jurisdictions and evaluators from across the United States in working together to further a culture of evidence-based decision making in government. This document proposes a series of technology solutions that help achieve this vision. The purpose of this document is to inform any site who might want to develop such a system. We recommend that jurisdictions seeking to develop this solution either join the AISP effort or work as a coordinating entity for a shared infrastructure. We pay particular attention to system workflow and technology components, but ultimately, our aim is to provide enough information for a developer to offer their own technology solutions to our proposed model.
