VAs the leading advocate for intergenerational
shared sites, Generations United and our partners
have extolled the cost effectiveness of
these programs while encouraging their proliferation.
While we heard story after story from
the field that supported this claim, there was
little research to underpin the argument. Now
we are pleased to release the results of the
first national study analyzing the costs of
intergenerational shared site programs.
