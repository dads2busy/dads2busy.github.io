The worlds of Policy Analysis and Program Evaluation, while overlapping and sharing similarities in terms of general logical approach, are quite different in their level of focus, level of detail, and overall purpose.  While the person put in charge of evaluating the success of a particular government program will be necessarily focused on whether or not predicted outcomes have been achieved or processes of delivery have been adequately established, the policy analyst will generally be more concerned with understanding the political and economic issues involved with the passage of a policy (which could affect many different programs) and how those issues will or will not make it possible to adjust the existing or create a new policy. Accordingly, this course will have two tracks, one focusing on the approaches and methods of Program Evaluation, the other on the approaches and methods of Policy Analysis.
