#### Remember: using the RPostgreSQL library, commands will generally look like:
* dbSendQuery(connection, "your sql statement") -- for commands that DON'T bring back data
* dbGetQuery(connection, "your sql statement") -- for commands that DO bring back data

##### The examples here go in to the "your sql statement" part

#### Create a table named "customers" with three columns
    create table customers (customer_no integer, first_name text, last_name text)

#### Delete a table named "customers"
    drop table customers

#### Insert into a table named "customers"
    insert into customers (customer_no, first_name, last_name) values (1, 'MC', 'Hammer')

#### Select all rows from a table named "customers"
    select *
    from customers

#### Select filtered rows from a table named "customers" where "first_name" equals a specific value
    select *
    from customers
    where last_name = 'Hammer'

#### Update values in a table named "customers" where "customer_no" equals a specific value
    update customers
    set first_name = 'Ralph'
    where customer_no = 1

#### Update values in a table named "customers" for ALL rows (be careful with this!)
    update customers
    set first_name = 'Ralph'

#### Select distinct (unique) values of a column (here "order_no") from the table "orders"
    select distinct(order_no)
    from orders

#### Count distinct (unique) values of a column (here "order_no") from the table "orders"
    select count(distinct(order_no))
    from orders

#### Create a new calculated column "total" in a select statement from the table "orders"
    select quantity, price, quantity*price total
    from orders

#### A Join (aka "Inner Join") between two tables "orders" and "products" -- An Inner Join will only return records that have a match
    select *
    from orders
    join products on orders.product_no = products.product_no

#### A Join (aka "Inner Join") between three tables "customers", "orders" and "products"
    select *
    from customers
    join orders on customers.customer_no = orders.customer_no
    join products on orders.product_no = products.product_no

#### A Join (aka "Inner Join") between three tables "customers", "orders" and "products" filtered by customer "last_name"
    select *
    from customers
    join orders on customers.customer_no = orders.customer_no
    join products on orders.product_no = products.product_no
    where customers.last_name = 'Hammer'

#### A Join (aka "Inner Join") between three tables "customers", "orders" and "products" filtered by customer "last_name", using aliases
    select *
    from customers c
    join orders o on c.customer_no = o.customer_no
    join products p on o.product_no = p.product_no
    where c.last_name = 'Hammer'

#### A Left Join between two tables "customers" and "orders" -- a Left Join will give you all records from the table on the left whether they have a match in the table on the right or not
    select *
    from customers c
    left join orders o on c.customer_no = o.customer_no

#### Writing the result of a query on "orders" to a new dynamically created table "my_new_table")
    select *
    into my_new_table
    from orders

#### Appending the result of a query on "orders" to an already existing table "order_archive"
    insert into order_archive (order_no, customer_no, product_no) (
    select *
    from orders
    )
