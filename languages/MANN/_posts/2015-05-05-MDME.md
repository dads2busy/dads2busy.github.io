The MDME project uses the framework created by the MANN project.  That is, MANN contains all the code and algorithms, MDME runs the MANN code with a specific set of parameters.

There are four (4) main files that you need to track before running an experiment:
  * Per-simulation files
      - config.ini
      - main.py
  * Batch and parameter sweep files
      - batch\_sweep.ini
      - batch\_sweep.py

I would suggest editing the files using a terminal editor, such as `nano`.  You can open a file when you are in the folder by typing, for example, `nano config.ini`

To run a single simulation, copy the `02-lens` folder with `cp 02-lens 02-lens-SIMULATION_NAME`.  Inside the newly copied folder, change the `config.ini` file to the desired parameters and run `python main.py`

To run a batch/sweep simulation, make sure the `02-lens/config.ini` contains your desired parameters, and also check the `batch_sweep.ini`.  When the two (2) files are set, run `python batch_sweep.py`

## Using the Multi-Agent Neural-Network Simulation Visualizer
### Setting up and downloading packages
Log into snowmane and install the following R packages:

    `install.packages(c('shiny', 'ggplot2', 'scales', 'foreach', 'doParallel', 'knitr', 'magrittr'))`

### Running the Shiny Application

Log into snowmane (note the added options to indicate a port number):

    `ssh -L 8777:localhost:8777 id@snowmane.vbi.vt.edu`

Navigate to the shiny application folder:

    `cd /home/sdal/mann/data/git/multidisciplinary-diffusion-model-experiments/src/R/shiny`

Run the application:

    `R --slave --no-restore -e 'shiny::runApp(".", port=8777)'`

open up a browser and go to `localhost:8777`

If you want to load the app multiple times, you can.  Just make a new ssh connection to snowmane and change the port number you are using
