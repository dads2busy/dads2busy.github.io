A considerable amount of data quality research involves investigating and describing various categories
of desirable attributes (or dimensions) of data. These lists commonly include accuracy, correctness,
currency, completeness and relevance, as described in Chapter 2. Nearly 200 such terms have been
identified and there is little agreement in their nature (are these concepts, goals or criteria?),
their definitions or measures (Wang et al., 1993). Here we have let a typology
emerge form the project data work. This typology consists of five data quality areas: completeness,
value validity, consistency, uniqueness, and duplication. Regardless the typology chosen,
the final judgment of data quality is measured by adherence of a dataset to a set of data quality rules.
Like data quality attributes, these rules can take one of several forms.
Here we choose a typology consisting of three rule-types employed by the DoD in its data quality management
efforts. These are: null constraint rules, domain validation rules,
and relationship validation rules. Code is developed to enforce these rules. For our study,
examples are given in psuedo-code:

<br /><br />
<table border="1" align="center" width = "90%">
  <tr>
    <td align="center">Null Constraints</td><td align="center">select sqft from housing where sqft = 0 or sqft = '' or sqrt = NULL</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">Domain Validation</td><td align="center"> select yearbuilt from housing where yearbuilt is between 1920 and 2015</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">Relationship Validation</td><td align="center">select all from housing where type = multifamily and numunits greater than 1</td>
  </tr>
</table>
