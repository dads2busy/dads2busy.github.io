Based on successful preliminary analysis of the US460 installation (see below), VDOT provided funding for a 10 mile section of Interstate 81 around Roanoke to covered with an 802.11 wireless spine, 9 digital cameras, and a series of digital traffic counters and weather stations. This project is being used as both a ‘further proof of concept’ and as a test-case for adjusting how DOTs procure operational IT systems (which are traditionally used for 15-30 year planning cycles).
