Contracted by the Virginia Department of Transportation in 2000 to investigate the feasibility of converting an existing ATIS, Travel Shenandoah (see below), into 511Virginia, an ATIS accessible to the public by dialing 511. Responsibilities included the design both conceptually, and technically of an enhanced coverage area and improved voice recognition technology. VTTI was responsible for the development and deployment of the new voice recognition technology.
