The goal of this project was to develop a detailed understanding of what would be required to undertake a wearable-technology pedestrian survey and to establish, as a foundation, the next step of technology prototyping. Over the long term, the goal would be to develop and deploy a wearable-technology pedestrian survey using wireless technologies, Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers, and clothingintegrated accelerometers. Such a deployment would benefit researchers in multiple domains including: human health and medicine, civic planning, and transportation.
