The creation of an early childhood education workforce personnel and training registry system for the Commonwealth of Virginia is necessary for two reasonsâ€”to provide the most complete and best understanding of the day care environment a child has experienced in concert with the child and provider data, and to establish a professional development tracking system for child care professionals. The relationship between practitioner level of education and types and level of training and impact on child outcomes, for example, can be accurately assessed. To build this system, practitioner, trainer and training core data elements will be adapted to existing standards and translated to a normalized relational structure to allow for accurate analysis and reporting. Additionally, the data system will incorporate linkages to existing data sources that already provide the needed core data elements. The resulting functional database system will be accessed through a web-based interface for both administrative management and participant interaction.
