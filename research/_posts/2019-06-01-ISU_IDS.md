Assisted ISU in the overall conceptualization and design of the separate processes, platforms, and infrastructure necessary to support an operational policy-oriented IDS. Additionally, supported the establishment of the Data Analytics Platform by developing the algorithms and attendant code to address current needs for a subset of the data analytics process, specifically, activities related to dataset profiling, preparation, and deduplication/linkage.
