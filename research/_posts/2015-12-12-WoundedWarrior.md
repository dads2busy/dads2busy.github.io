Assessed the current service experiences (consumer satisfaction), emerging and unserved needs and service gaps within the range of veteran’s services available in the Commonwealth of Virginia. There are over 800,000 veterans residing within the Commonwealth of Virginia. While all veterans’ experiences and needs were assessed, particular consideration was given to the mental and behavioral health and traumatic brain injury service needs of the veterans of Operation Iraq Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF).
