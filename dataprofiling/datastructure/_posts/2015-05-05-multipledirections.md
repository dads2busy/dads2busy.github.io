A particularly messy structural issue occurs when a dataset has variable names in both columns and rows. For example, a dataset with an field/column for each day of the month (on the horizontal) and a row title for 'month' (on the vertical). This situation occurs most often when the data provided comes in the form of and cross-tabulated aggregate data.
