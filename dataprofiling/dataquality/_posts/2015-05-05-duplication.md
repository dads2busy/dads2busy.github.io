A measure of the degree of replication of distinct observations per observation unit type

e.g. greater than 1 registration per student per official reporting period note. Duplication can occur as a result of choice of level of aggregation; for example, aggregating to a single student registration per academic year when registration information is actually collected multiple times per academic year.
