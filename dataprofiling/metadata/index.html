Metadata is generally defined "data that provides information about other data".
[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/metadata].
The main purpose of metadata is the facilitation of the discovery relevant information pertaining
to a particular object/resource. It does this by "allowing resources to be found by relevant criteria,
identifying resources, bringing similar resources together, distinguishing dissimilar resources,
and giving location information."[National Information Standards Organization; Rebecca Guenther; Jaqueline Radebaugh (2004).
Understanding Metadata. Bethesda, MD: NISO Press. ISBN 1-880124-62-9. Retrieved 2 April 2014.]
Therefore, generally speaking, a lack of metadata for a dataset can present significant impediments to the use of
said dataset.

Being more specific, when dealing with data that is to be used for research purposes, it is of vital
importance to discover if the datasets (tables), their observational observation units (records/rows),
and their attributes (fields/columns) are consistently named, sufficiently described, and appropriately
formatted for analysis and for combination with other project datasets. Additionally, does information
exist regrading any transformations that have occurred to original data sources in the creation of said
dataset, as well as who did the transforming?
