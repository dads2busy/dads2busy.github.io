The mission of the Information Applications Program was to utilize information technology and
inter-institutional (e.g.	public-private) partnerships to develop and deploy new	or enhanced public
services.	Responsibilities include the management of existing program development and
deployment projects,	procurement of all program funding, management of program relationships
with private and public-sector personnel and political representatives,	and coordinating with other
Institute research programs.	The Information Applications Group was founded in 1998	and has
quickly grown	to become the second largest research group at the Institute.	Statistics as	of 2002	for
the center were:	over $3	million in committed contract funding, 20	staff members (programmers,
policy analysts,	marketing analysts,	lawyers,	project managers), 4	associated Virginia	Tech faculty
members,	and 11 graduate research assistants (representing Systems Engineering, Public
Administration,	Computer Science, and Marketing).
