Schroeder, A.D. Panelist: Virginia Longitudinal Data System—Accessing Multiple Datasets and Merging Records. 26th Annual Management Information Systems (MIS) Conference, The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), U.S. Department of Education’s Institute of Education Sciences (IES). The Virginia Longitudinal Data System (VLDS) provides researchers with access to data from multiple datasets. These data are available only after cohort records from the datasets have been matched, requiring either a common identifier or performing matching routines. This presentation provided a description and demonstration of the solution used by the VLDS and addressed some of the challenges presented with working with multiple, disparate datasets.
