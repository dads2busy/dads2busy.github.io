      <h4 class="title2">A.D.D.? No, Polymath!</h4>
      One day I was sitting in my office whining about being so professionally A.D.D. (data management, policy analysis,
      public administration, transportation, wireless, emergency management, sports management, yadda, yadda...)
      when a colleague looked at me quizzickly and said that I was NOT A.D.D. and that I was in fact a "POLYMATH."
      I was so relieved to to hear that there was a more high-falutin' name for my condition! Apparently I am simply
      a renaissance man in a modern hyper-specialized world. Da Vinci in Singapore! Thanks Max for a whole new outlook!

      <h4 class="title2">What&#39;s a polymath?</h4>
      <p>1. a person whose expertise fills a significant number of subject areas. From
      the Greek polymathēs, πολυμαθής, &quot;having learned much.&quot;
      <br />
      Wikipedia</p>
      <p>2. a highly functioning person with Attention Deficit Disorder (A.D.D.) who hangs around universities long enough
      to be awarded various degrees, ostensibly to entice the person to go away (unless, of course, they are good at bringing in grant money)."
