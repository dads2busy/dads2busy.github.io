Snowballing is a simple process of expanding the zone of contacts through initial contacts. The process begins by identifying an initial group of data stakeholders,  hopefully those who are already involved in the preliminary stages of the process. These actors or participants are then asked to identify those individuals whom they feel should be involved in the data discovery process as well. This is the “first-order” zone. The researcher then proceeds to contact those actors (whether individuals or groups) and proceeds to have these “second-order” actors, further identify others who they think would have an interest in the project or process (Wasserman and Faust, 1994: 34; see also Goldenberg, 1992; Babbie, 1998; Doreian and Woodward, 1992).
