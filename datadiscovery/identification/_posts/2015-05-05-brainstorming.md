## Suggested Plan for Group Brainstorming to Identify Data Sources for Analytical Policy Analysis

**Purpose:**  
To systematically identify relevant, reliable, and available data sources that will inform an analytical policy analysis, using structured group brainstorming techniques.

---

### 1. **Preparation**

- **Define the Policy Problem:**  
  Clearly articulate the policy issue, objectives, and the key questions that the analysis must address. This focuses the brainstorming on data relevant to the analytical goals[5][3].

- **Assemble a Diverse Group:**  
  Include staff, key partners, stakeholders, and, where possible, community representatives who bring varied perspectives and knowledge about potential data sources[1][3].

- **Gather Materials:**  
  Prepare chart paper, markers, digital collaboration tools (if remote), and any relevant background information or previous data lists[1].

---

### 2. **Structured Brainstorming Session**

**A. Introduction (10 minutes)**

- Brief the group on the policy problem, objectives, and the importance of identifying comprehensive data sources.
- Outline the session’s structure and encourage open, judgment-free idea sharing[2].

**B. Individual Idea Generation (10 minutes)**

- Ask participants to spend a few minutes individually listing all potential data sources they can think of, considering both traditional (e.g., government reports, surveys) and non-traditional (e.g., social media, administrative data, stakeholder feedback) sources[4][5].

**C. Group Sharing and Expansion (20 minutes)**

- Go around the group, with each participant sharing one idea at a time, while a facilitator records all suggestions on a visible board or digital platform.
- Encourage building on others’ ideas and exploring less obvious sources, such as competitor data, open data portals, or community-generated information[2][4].

**D. Prompted Exploration (10 minutes)**

- Use structured prompts to ensure breadth:
  - What quantitative data (e.g., statistics, metrics) is available?
  - What qualitative sources (e.g., interviews, case studies) could be useful?
  - Are there relevant data from other sectors, regions, or countries?
  - What unpublished or informal data might exist within organizations or communities[5][1]?

---

### 3. **Prioritization and Gap Analysis**

- **Cluster and Categorize:**  
  Group similar data sources and categorize them (e.g., administrative, survey, big data, qualitative)[5][4].

- **Assess Relevance, Availability, and Reliability:**  
  Quickly evaluate each source for its relevance to the policy question, accessibility, and trustworthiness[5].

- **Identify Gaps:**  
  Note areas where data is missing or insufficient, which may require new data collection or alternative approaches[5][3].

---

### 4. **Documentation and Next Steps**

- **Record All Outputs:**  
  Document the full list of suggested data sources, including notes on their strengths, limitations, and any follow-up actions needed (e.g., verifying access, seeking permissions)[1][5].

- **Feedback and Validation:**  
  Circulate the compiled list to participants and other stakeholders for validation and additional suggestions[3].

- **Plan for Data Collection:**  
  Develop a work plan for obtaining, processing, and analyzing the prioritized data sources as the next step in the policy analysis process[3][4].

| Brainstorming                | Generate diverse data source ideas      | Individual listing, group sharing        |
| Prompted Exploration         | Ensure breadth and depth                | Use prompts for types and sectors        |
| Prioritization & Gap Analysis| Focus on actionable, relevant sources   | Cluster, assess, identify gaps           |
| Documentation & Next Steps   | Ensure follow-through and completeness  | Record, validate, plan data collection   |

**Tips for Success:**

- Use visuals (charts, sticky notes, digital boards) to keep ideas visible and spark further creativity[2].
- Encourage participation from all group members, including quieter voices.
- Consider follow-up sessions or online surveys to capture additional ideas after the meeting[1].

This structured, participatory approach ensures a comprehensive and relevant mapping of data sources, laying a strong foundation for evidence-based policy analysis[1][5][3].
