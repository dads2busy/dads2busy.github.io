The first step in before conducting a full data inventory is to screen the data sources, identifying which sources are worthy of a deeper look and which are worthy of consideration for profiling. The screening includes five questions and a qualitative evaluation of purpose, data collection method, selectivity, accessibility, and description.

Example from a recent project:

Screening Inventory Process
1. Are the data collected opinion-based, (e.g., people’s attitudes, preferences, etc.)?
2. Are the data collection recurring, (i.e., must be collected at least annually)?
3. Are there data available for 2013?
4. Geographic granularity
    * For Education
    1. Are the data collected at least the school level?
    2. Can the data be linked to other education/workforce datasets, (e.g., K-12, higher education, workforce)?
    3. If this is a state dataset, how do they define school districts within this state?
    4. If applicable, what types of schools does it cover, (¢.g.. public, private, charter)?
    * For Housing
    1. Are the data collected at the property or housing unit level?
